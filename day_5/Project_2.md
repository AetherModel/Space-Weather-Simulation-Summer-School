# Group Project 2: User interface to display the JB2008 and TIE-GCM models and comparison
Description: In the project, the students will work together to analyze and visualize the difference in predicted densities by the JB2008 density model and the TIE-GCM density model by creating functions that display differences in the models.


## Task 1: Download the dst index for the year 2002 from the NASA OmniWeb database
For this work, we are only interested in evaluating the differences between the two density models during high space weather events (i.e. large dst value). You first need to select a time period where the dst index is high in the year 2002 (including 5 hours prior and 5 hours after the high space weather event). *Note: as the density data are in hourly format, we will first need to convert the high temporal resolution of the dst index into a lower temporal resolution of an hour. This can be achieved using data slicing.*


## Task 2: Evaluete Mean and Standard Deviation of the models
After identifying the period of interest, evaluate the mean density for both models and the relative standard deviation. Display them together on the same figures as 3\sigma.
