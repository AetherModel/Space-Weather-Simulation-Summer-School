# Group Project 3: Storm detection and analysis
Description: In the project, the students will work together to analize OMNI data and to highlight the presence of storms.


## Task 1: Download the assingment file form day 2 and follow exercize 2
For this work, we are only interested in evaluating the differences between the two density models during high space weather events (i.e. large dst value). You first need to select a time period where the dst index is high in the year 2002 (including 5 hours prior and 5 hours after the high space weather event), save also the data for the whole month. *Note: as the density data are in hourly format, we will first need to convert the high temporal resolution of the dst index into a lower temporal resolution of an hour. This can be achieved using data slicing.*

## Task 2: Improve your work
Repeat the exercize by creating a function where the user selects the week in 2013. 

## Task 3: Which week has the most events
Use your function to compare the number of events during each week of the year: dispaly the results. Looking at Quasai's day 4 material, you can save figures for each week and create an animation that covers the whole year.

## Task 4: Create your own tasks
Now that you worked with the data, which function do you think is needed? Which representation, according to you, gives the best represntation for the number of storms? In the same way, you can repeat Task 1-2-3 for different years and give a visulaization on how storms are changing in the long run. You are limited by your imagination, have fun!
