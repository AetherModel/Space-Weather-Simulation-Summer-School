Since this is a programming course, you are expected to bring a laptop into class.

Course Description
------------------

Have you ever been writing a bunch of code and then at some point it gets out of control and becomes hard to manage? Have you ever looked at code you wrote from a long time ago and don't remember what it's supposed to *do*? Do you have a piece of code that works and you're too afraid too touch it in case you might break it? We all have these fears and anxieties, this course will address them and help you become a better programmer.

Programming is becoming an exceedingly important skill for us scientists. Most scientists only learn how to code be self-teaching programming in graduate school. This course will alleviate the difficulties you might face in that phase of your scientific career. The skills and knowledge gained from this class is widely applicable to any project you will be working on for the rest of your scientific future.

Learning Objectives
-------------------

The aim of this course is to make you a strong and capable science programmer. By the end of this course:

- You will develop skills to write clear and readable code.
- You will will be able to employ programming patterns to their code.
- You will be able to collaborate and code as a team.
- You will be able to manage your code effectively.
- You will be able to avoid writing buggy code.

Remember those points while we are learning throughout the semester.

Assessment & Grading
--------------------

The class will be divided by a lecture portion and a presentation portation. Both will include active participation in terms of clicker questions for the lectures. A student will present their homework to class and you are expected to comment and give your thoughts on how to improve this code. This is because making clear and readable code is part of our learning goals.

Every week you will have homework you will need to submit before class in preparation which will be outlined in course webpage. If you make sure to do this you will come to class prepared to understand how you can improve as a programmer.

This course is a 1 credit hour course and will only have a Pass/Fail grade. Nobody is perfect and as long as you're able to achieve 80% effort you will pass, but you should strive for 100% anyway. This means that as this is a 14 week course try not to miss more than 3 classes. You will have one homework a week so try not to miss more than 3 homeworks. You will be expected to present at least once so make sure it will happen this semester.

If this might cause a problem for you or you will need accomodations please see me as soon as possible. I am invested in your success and want to see you grow as a scientist and programmer.
