Final Project
=============

## Project A

Solve and plot the the temperature using steady-state heat equation using the 
data and functions from `day_7` and `day_8`:

$$
\frac{\partial^2 T_i}{\partial z^2} = - \frac{Q_{EUV}}{4 \cdot 10^{-4}}
$$

## Project B

Using RK4 solve the below question for 24 hours:

$$
\frac{\partial T_i}{\partial t} = \frac{Q_{EUV}}{1500 \cdot \rho_i}
$$

start with a 5 min time step. If you have time, make an animation and explain
what is seen.

## Project C
